Subsets:
Given a set with distinct elements, find all of its distinct subsets.

Example 1:
    Input: [1, 3]
    Output: [], [1], [3], [1,3]
    
Example 2:
    Input: [1, 5, 3]
    Output: [], [1], [5], [3], [1,5], [1,3], [5,3], [1,5,3]

SOLUTION:
To generate all subsets of the given set, we can use the Breadth First Search (BFS) approach.
We can start with an empty set, iterate through all numbers one-by-one, and add them to existing sets to create new subsets.

Letâ€™s take an example to go through each step of our algorithm:
    Given set: [1, 5, 3]

    Start with an empty set: [[]]
    Add the first number (1) to all the existing subsets to create new subsets: [[], [1]];
    Add the second number (5) to all the existing subsets: [[], [1], [5], [1,5]];
    Add the third number (3) to all the existing subsets: [[], [1], [5], [1,5], [3], [1,3], [5,3], [1,5,3]].
